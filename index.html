          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            From a young age, I've always been drawn to competition and
            challenge, finding joy in puzzles, Sudoku, Rubik's cubes, and
            mathematics. This drive led me to chess during the pandemic, where I
            achieved a 2300+ rating on Lichess within eight months. My passion
            for problem-solving didn't stop there—it naturally extended into
            Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and competitive programming,
            areas where I've tackled over 550 problems on LeetCode and more than
            150 on GeeksforGeeks.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the realm of technology, I specialize in C++ and Python
            programming, deeply engaging with the MERN stack and core JavaScript
            to create projects like weather APIs and loan calculators. My
            portfolio includes 5 full-stack projects, with 4 developed in
            CodeIgniter and one in MERN.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've enriched my knowledge through online courses in Full Stack Web
            Development, Advanced Node.js, and a Data Structures and Algorithms
            specialization from the University of Stanford. Furthermore, I'm
            well-versed in core CS subjects, including Data Structures and
            Algorithms, Operating Systems, and Object-Oriented Programming,
            reflecting my comprehensive understanding of the field. Notably, my
            problem-solving journey on LeetCode has now surpassed 550
            challenges.
